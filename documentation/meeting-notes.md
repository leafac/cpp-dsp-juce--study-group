Aline is a special guest. She‚Äôs a friend of Leandro‚Äôs from college.

Leandro introduced how to program a Raspberry Pi Pico with CircuitPython, which will be part of the EWI project pitched last meeting.

Bo showed the code for a JSFX which splits the signal between low and high frequencies and distorts the low frequencies.

Fotis is developing a user interface in HISE, and also showed a sequencer that runs in the browser and works by drawing shapes. Finally, he showed as a vocoder effect done in TurboSynth, from back in the 90s(!)

Fotis tried to get HISE‚Äôs new feature of time stretching to work, both from the GUI as well as from a script, but it didn‚Äôt work. Yet.

Cwits showed us some file editing features in his project: cutting and pasting sections of audio, reversing audio, and so forth.

Bo showed us some JSFX with a really clever idea for distortion in which the coefficient of a low-pass filter is modulated with the incoming signal.

Leandro pitched an idea of a EWI with a Raspberry Pi Pico, showed a Hammerspoon script that disables a MacBook keyboard for cleaning, and worked on Project Euler‚Äôs problem 9.

Fotis showed some updates to HISE, wrote some JSFX for sliders, and brought The Signal State for us to play together.

Cwits is dealing with weird edge cases in MIDI files.

Leandro coded Project Euler problem 8. We learned to use vectors and that we need to be mindful of `int` overflows.

Cwits got all parts working and is able to record and playback audio üôå

Leandro solved Project Euler problem 7 and showed that brute force goes a long way.

Fotis showed a sketch of the user interface for his new not-Juno synthesizer, and showed a bunch of other interesting things. His homework is to come up with sliders for a time vs musical divisions modification he wants to do to a JSFX.

Bo talked about his Revolver compressor, an RMS-based compressor with novel transfer curves. He also showed his implementation a really nerdy way of going about BPMs.

  > I just spent a couple hours playing around with this circuit. Here‚Äôs what I learned:
  >
  > 1. The trick that made it work for me was to shine a bright light close to the LDR. Like Sam did in the video, I used my phone light.
  >
  > 2. If you just want to play around with the circuit, you can use a breadboard.
  >
  > 3. I tried a couple transistors with the middle leg still on, even with the middle leg connected to the breadboard. It worked ü§∑
  >
  > 4. The type of LDR will change the range. I found that the GL5539 worked the best from me, after having tried the GL5506, GL5516, GL5528, GL5537, and the GL5549. But they all worked to some extent.
  >
  > 5. Different kinds of transistors gave me different frequencies. With the 2N3904 I could only produce annoyingly high-pitched sounds, no matter how big the capacitor. With the BC547 I got sounds similar to Sam‚Äôs. The BC337 also worked, though less pleasing. And the BC517 was my favorite. Fun stuff. I didn‚Äôt even need the phone light for the oscillation to start with all of these, except for the 2N3904. If playing around with different transistors remember to swap the legs around, because the pinouts are different.
  >
  > 6. It won‚Äôt take just a couple of minutes to put together üòâ
  >
  > Overall, really enjoyable experiment. Thanks, Sam!

- Leandro‚Äôs progress:
  - Ergonomics: Having to close and reopen REAPER to load a new version of a VST.
    - Tale told me a probable reason for this: REAPER keeps the VST loaded in memory; on Windows one isn‚Äôt even able to overwrite the VST file while a DAW has it open.
    - Tried to get the plugin to load in Live, just to check. But Live doesn‚Äôt pick it up. Probably because Xcode puts it under `~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/`, instead of `/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/` ü§∑
  - Plugin still crashes REAPER from time to time.
  - Using Tale‚Äôs trick of outputting RMS as audio, it turns out that RMS computation is wrong! ü§∑
  - Plugin delays on different automixed tracks could be an issue!

  - Cwits made a whole engine capable of loading audio-processing modules into a Raspberry Pi and controlling them via an Ableton Push.
  - Fotis made some progress through the video tutorials on JUCE and started looking into Cabbage & DIN Is Noise.
  - Leandro got RMS computation of arbitrary sizes working (probably).

[**Meeting**](https://youtube.com/live/xagHKQTdMd4)

- Progress:
  - Fotis followed along some The Audio Programmer tutorials, but got stuck, and we helped him get unstuck. He‚Äôll continue with the tutorials and think about some synth ideas.
  - Cwits found a library able to communicate with Push from a Raspberry Pi. He also found some algorithms like delay and filters. He‚Äôll now try to connect the controller code to the audio-processing code.
  - Leandro found a way to compute RMS with JUCE. It turns out that it may not give the control necessary for the automixer to work (bigger window sizes independent of the buffer size). He‚Äôll now come up with a custom RMS computation.

[**Meeting**](https://youtube.com/live/v4YRmSR6VC8)

- We talked about our goals.
  - **Fotis:** Learn how synthesizers work, for example, what makes a synth from brand X different from brand Y. Explore CLAP.
  - **Victor:** Learn how the mathematics, music, and code come together. Build a custom livelooping that works well for accompanying monophonic instruments (flute).
  - **Tom:** Build a standalone application with PulseAudio, instead of a plugin that‚Äôs loaded into a DAW. Build delays & reverbs for guitar. Build an instrument similar to theremin that‚Äôs controlled with something like a Leap Motion.
  - **Cwits:** Learn how the mathematics, music, and code come together. Build basic plugins like delays.
  - **Leandro:** Develop a version of his [Automixer](https://github.com/leafac/reaper/tree/da940056c122ceb7f8d7f23499afef451c5fd8ae#automixer) that works in every DAW.
- We reported success in building the basic example code given by APIs/frameworks of choice.
- We looked at the basic example code generated by Projucer and discussed the lifecycle of a plugin and some C++.
- We chose a task that will take us towards our goals that‚Äôs small enough we can finish it until next meeting (2022-03-01).

# 2022-02-01

[**Meeting**](https://youtube.com/live/FutGtjbElBA)

We started by introducing ourselves. We have some people who are new to programming, and so people who are authors of C++ programming books(!)

**Logistics**

We‚Äôll meet every 15 days for about 1~1.5h. We‚Äôll communicate on Discord, Skype, and over here on this GitHub repository, where we‚Äôll also share the code we end up writing.

**Materials**

- YouTube videos & channels to check:
  - Awesome introductions to how audio is represented digitally that clears up some misconceptions: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIQ9IXSUzuM>
  - Another video by the same person, which covers other kinds of digital signals (images and videos): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG9jemV1T7I>
  - Excellent practical demonstrations of some basic concepts such as aliasing distortion, sampling rates, and so forth, and practical aspects when dealing with music production: <https://www.youtube.com/c/DanWorrall> & <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxihtGe18Br6U8RuYCt-hDw>
  - Our own channels, in which we‚Äôve been live-coding audio effects for almost a year, but using REAPER‚Äôs JSFX, not C++:
    - <https://www.youtube.com/c/IDDQDMusic>
    - <https://www.youtube.com/c/leafac>
- Victor‚Äôs book on C++: <https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/CompEdu/pdf/isp/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf>
- An introductory book on Digital Signal Processing: <http://www.dspguide.com/>
  - Great explanations.
  - Suitable for beginners.
  - A bit old, so take the parts about hardware with a grain of salt.
- _Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++_, by Will Pirkle. A book recommended by [Justin Johnson](https://github.com/Justin-Johnson), of [ReEQ](https://github.com/Justin-Johnson/ReJJ) fame.

**Goals for Next Week**

- Setting an objective. Examples: Making a synthesizer, making a compressor, contributing to an existing open-source project, learning how a reverb works.
- Digital Signal Processing:
  - Have a basic understanding of Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) and what some audio effects do: EQ, compression, delay, reverb, distortion, and so forth.
  - Understand how digital audio is represented: floating points, sampling rates, bit depths, frequency, amplitude, audio-to-digital conversation and digital-to-audio conversion, DC, Nyquist frequency, aliasing, time-domain vs frequency domain, and so forth.
  - How to make sense of what‚Äôs displayed in an oscilloscope (time-domain) and on a frequency spectrum analyzer (frequency domain).
  - Get a point where the first chapter of _Designing Audio Effect Plug-Ins in C++_ makes sense.
- Programming:
  - Setting up a project for an audio plugin, getting it to compile, and running it inside a DAW. Either using JUCE or something else.
